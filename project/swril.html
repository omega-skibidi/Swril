        <p>aviation is the field focused on the design, development, and use of aircraft, and it has revolutionized how people travel and connect worldwide. It began with the Wright brothers' historic powered flight in 1903, marking the birth of modern aviation. Planes quickly advanced, playing key roles in both World Wars and evolving from simple biplanes to powerful jet aircraft. By the mid-20th century, commercial aviation made global travel faster and more accessible, changing economies and cultures. Today, aviation includes passenger jets, cargo planes, military aircraft, and drones, supported by complex systems of airports and air traffic control. With growing concerns about the environment, the industry is moving toward greener solutions like electric planes and sustainable fuels, continuing to push the limits of innovation and exploration.
