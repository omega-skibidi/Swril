        <p>Aviation is the field focused on the design, development, and use of aircraft, and it has revolutionized how people travel and connect worldwide. It began with the Wright brothers' historic powered flight in 1903, marking the birth of modern aviation. Planes quickly advanced, playing key roles in both World Wars and evolving from simple biplanes to powerful jet aircraft. By the mid-20th century, commercial aviation made global travel faster and more accessible, changing economies and cultures. Today, aviation includes passenger jets, cargo planes, military aircraft, and drones, supported by complex systems of airports and air traffic control. With growing concerns about the environment, the industry is moving toward greener solutions like electric planes and sustainable fuels, continuing to push the limits of innovation and exploration.

<p class="oversite">Airbus is a leading global aerospace company, best known for designing and manufacturing commercial aircraft, military planes, helicopters, and space systems. It was founded in 1970 as a European consortium to compete with U.S. aerospace firms, and its headquarters are located in Toulouse, France. The company is a direct competitor to Boeing and has a massive influence on global aviation. Airbus revolutionized the aviation industry with the A320 family, a best-selling single-aisle jet featuring fly-by-wire technology. It also built the A380, the world’s largest passenger aircraft, capable of carrying over 800 people. Other key models include the A330, A350, and the military A400M. Airbus is known for its fuel-efficient designs, use of composite materials, and advanced aerodynamics. Beyond planes, Airbus manufactures helicopters through Airbus Helicopters and is active in satellite and space missions with the European Space Agency. It has major production facilities in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, with final assembly lines in China and the U.S. Airbus employs over 130,000 people worldwide. The company is also investing in hydrogen-powered aircraft and electric propulsion to meet environmental goals. It is working toward launching zero-emission planes by 2035. Airbus supports military and defense sectors with surveillance and refueling aircraft. It plays a major role in European space exploration, satellites, and Earth observation. Its helicopters serve in medical, military, and transport operations globally. Airbus aircraft are used by nearly all major airlines worldwide. Known for innovation and safety, it continues to shape the future of aviation. With sustainability as a priority, Airbus leads the push toward greener skies. It represents European cooperation, engineering excellence, and global impact in aerospace.

    <p class="boeing">Boeing is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies and a leading manufacturer of commercial airplanes, military aircraft, satellites, and defense systems. Founded in 1916 in Seattle, Washington, by William E. Boeing, the company played a crucial role in the development of early aviation in the 20th century. Its headquarters are now located in Arlington, Virginia, USA. Boeing's commercial aircraft division is famous for iconic models like the 707 (first successful jetliner), the 747 "Jumbo Jet," the 737 (the world’s most-sold aircraft), and newer models like the 777 and 787 Dreamliner. The 787 uses lightweight composite materials and advanced technology to improve fuel efficiency. Boeing is a key defense contractor, producing fighter jets like the F-15 and F/A-18, as well as Apache helicopters, military drones, and surveillance systems. It also contributes to space exploration with NASA, supplying rockets and spacecraft for missions including the Artemis program. Boeing has global operations, with major facilities across the U.S. and partners in many countries. The company employs over 140,000 people and supports thousands of suppliers worldwide. It provides commercial services like aircraft maintenance, training, and digital solutions. Though known for innovation, Boeing has faced challenges, including the grounding of the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes. The company has since focused on improving safety and restoring trust. Boeing is also investing in autonomous flight, sustainable aviation fuels, and future urban air mobility. Its research aims to cut carbon emissions and meet global climate goals. Boeing’s legacy includes pioneering work in aviation, setting industry standards, and enabling millions of global flights. Today, it remains a vital player in the global aerospace industry.</p>
